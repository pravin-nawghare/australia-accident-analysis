# Australian Road Accidents Insights - Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze historical road accident data in Australia from 1960 to 2024 to identify key trends, contributing factors, and the effectiveness of past safety measures. 
By leveraging data-driven insights, this analysis aims to provide recommendations for improving road safety policies, infrastructure, and public awareness initiatives to reduce accident rates and enhance 
overall traffic safety.

## Background and Overview
Road safety has been a significant concern in Australia for decades, with thousands of accidents occurring each year. Since 1960, government agencies, policymakers, and researchers have worked to understand the factors contributing to road accidents and develop strategies to improve traffic safety. Various policies, technological advancements, and awareness campaigns have influenced accident trends over the years, but challenges remain in reducing fatalities and injuries on Australian roads.  

This project analyzes historical road accident data from 1960 to 2024, examining key factors such as accident severity, location, driver demographics. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to uncover long-term trends, assess the impact of past safety measures, and identify areas that require further intervention.  

Now, with an increasing focus on road safety, policymakers and transportation authorities seek a deeper understanding of accident patterns. The primary objectives of this analysis are:  
1) To identify the major causes and risk factors associated with road accidents in Australia.  
2) To provide actionable insights for reducing accident rates and improving road safety policies.

## Summary
- **72882** total accidents has been recorded in Australia till *31st December 2024* and **56756** peoples are died in these fatal accidents which means in *every 100 accidents 77 people dies*. 
- In 2024, 1549 accidents happened in which 1279 people died. This figure is **4.3%** more than people died in 2023.
- **Heavy vehicles** like trucks, containers, etc. caused *16%* of total accidents and accounts for *11%* of total deaths.
- **December** accounts for highest number of deaths (4601) whereas **February** for lowest (3899). 
- On weekends (Friday and Saturday) majority of accidents happens.
- **50%** of total accidents are happening only in *New South Wales and Victoria.*

## Insights deep dive
**Breakdown by months**
- December is considered as a holiday season therefore this month accounts for number of accidents more than *5000* followed March and the same trend is also seen in terms of deaths also.
-  It is unclear why **March ranks second** in terms of accidents as well as in death count where *February* have least number of accidents and therefore, lesser number of deaths.
- On an average around 4700 accidents happens every month in Australia in which around 4300 peoples dies.

**Speed of Vehicle**
- *Overspeeding* is the main cause of accidents. Most accidents happens when the vehicle is going above **90km/h** in a city region.
- It is observed that most of the times the driver of the overspeeding vehicle is either a *teenager* or a *young adult* less than 25 years of age.
- Death to accident ratio is lowest when speed is greater than 120km/hr that is because this type of speed is acheivable mostly on highways. 
- But in cities if the speed is in between 30-60km/hr the ratio rises to 92%. The rise is because cities are densly populated as compared to highways and because of this most of the **accidents** happening on *highways involves heavy trucks and vehicles.*
- If the speed is greater than *30km/hr*, either **pedestrain** or **pedal cyclist** is involved in an accident then *95%* of times they are dead. This count is highest compared to other road user type.
- Out of total accidents 45% of the time the driver dies. Followed by the passenger 22.73% and 15.4% is the pedestrian.

**Road Type**
- 32000 cases are their were the exact loaction of accident is unknown.
- *Arterial Road and National* or *State Highway* are the one where generally the vehicle speed is greater than 60km/hr and therefore accounts for most number of accidents.
- *Pedestrian Thoroughfare* and *Busway* only recorded few accidents but every time people invovled in accident died.

**Time**
- **Mondays** are best because on monday  *least* number of accidents happens. But as we progress towards the end of the week this number rises rapidly.
- People likes to enjoy their weekends and therefore this time of the week most number of accidents happens mainly on *Friday*, 50% of total accidents happens at this time.
- On weekdays from 6 in the morning till 6 in the evening the accidents are highest whereas on weekends at evening after 6 o'clock till 2am accidents are mostly happening at this time.
- Reasons are not clear but at 3am at the midnight on weekdays a sudden spike in number of accident is seen.
