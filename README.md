# Australian Road Accidents Insights - Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze historical road accident data in Australia from 1960 to 2024 to identify key trends, contributing factors, and the effectiveness of past safety measures. 
By leveraging data-driven insights, this analysis aims to provide recommendations for improving road safety policies, infrastructure, and public awareness initiatives to reduce accident rates and enhance 
overall traffic safety.

## Background and Overview
Road safety has been a significant concern in Australia for decades, with thousands of accidents occurring each year. Since 1960, government agencies, policymakers, and researchers have worked to understand the factors contributing to road accidents and develop strategies to improve traffic safety. Various policies, technological advancements, and awareness campaigns have influenced accident trends over the years, but challenges remain in reducing fatalities and injuries on Australian roads.  

This project analyzes historical road accident data from 1960 to 2024, examining key factors such as accident severity, location, driver demographics. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to uncover long-term trends, assess the impact of past safety measures, and identify areas that require further intervention.  

Now, with an increasing focus on road safety, policymakers and transportation authorities seek a deeper understanding of accident patterns. The primary objectives of this analysis are:  
1) To identify the major causes and risk factors associated with road accidents in Australia.  
2) To provide actionable insights for reducing accident rates and improving road safety policies.
